## Project Ideas

- Web app for process automation using Anthropic API for code generation and LightOn Paradigm API for LLM-based workflow steps

## Paradigm API Integration Notes

- Created initial backend using Docsearch and Chat Completion API endpoints
- Next step: Integrate AnalyseDoc tool API endpoint (/api/v2/chat/document-analysis)
- AnalyseDoc must support chaining with Docsearch by using document IDs from previous searches
- Key API endpoints:
  - POST /api/v2/chat/document-analysis (initiate document analysis)
  - GET /api/v2/chat/document-analysis/{chat_response_id} (retrieve analysis results)
- Required parameters for document analysis:
  - query (analysis request)
  - document_ids (list of documents to analyze)
- Optional parameters:
  - model (specific language model)
  - private (privacy setting)

## File Upload Functionality

- Add new feature to upload documents to user's personal workspace using POST /api/v2/files endpoint
- Support uploading files with different collection types:
  - 'private' for personal workspace
  - 'company' for company workspace
  - 'workspace' for other workspaces (requires workspace_id)
- Documents will be automatically parsed, chunked, and embedded
- Use uploaded document IDs for subsequent workflow steps like document search or analysis
- Key file upload API capabilities:
  - Automatically index uploaded documents in SQL database
  - Associate documents with owner, company, and collection
  - Return document metadata including ID, filename, size, and embedding status

## Code Generation Requirements

- Whatever you do, I want the code generated by claude in the workflow generator to be standalone and contain full Paradigm API documentation

## Development Guidelines

- don't modify the front end file
